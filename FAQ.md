# Frequently Asked Questions

## Before Getting Started

### What benefits would I gain from running my X-Road Security Server on AWS?



### When should I not run my X-Road Security Server on AWS?

Are you planning on running the associated workload (Consumer or Producer Information System) eventually on AWS? 
Running only the Security Server on AWS is unlikely to bring significant benefits to your infrastructure and is 
likely to make your daily operations and maintenance work more complex.

Do you have any regulatory data governance requirements for your workloads that could restrict how and where
your or your customers' data can be processed? If so, please [contact AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) 
or an [X-Road Technology Partner](https://x-road.global/xroad-technology-partners-companies) to discuss the
specifics of your use case before deciding to build your X-Road workload on AWS.
